# Trains!
### A train game!

#### With lights and sounds and trains eating trains and then the eating was removed and now they just bump into each other and maybe we'll have explosions one day and who knows what else.

How to get up and running on Windows:

1. Install Ruby (http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/)
1. Download and extract Ruby Dev Kit to somewhere **permanent**
1. Add Ruby Dev Kit to your PATH
1. Install NodeJS (https://nodejs.org/)
1. Run (from the working directory): `gem install bundle`
1. Run: `bundle install`
1. Bang head on wall until everything works
1. Ready to go! Run `rackup` or maybe `bundle exec rackup` to start



YMMV. We don't actually know what we're doing.
